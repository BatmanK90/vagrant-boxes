# vagrant-boxes
Vagrant boxes for my own use.

## `docker-host`

This box is useful if you are forced to use a Windows environment, but need a DevOps environment ready-to-go.
Hit the Readme inside the `docker-host` directory for details.

## `docker-registry`

This box is useful if you need a ready-to-go Docker Registry to hack against. The registry is accessible from other VMs on the same machine, or from your Windows machine as well.
Hit the Readme inside the `docker-registry` dir for more details.
